This Python code converts an angle measurement from radians to degrees. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how the code works:

Code Description:
Importing the Math Module:

import math: This imports Python's math module, which provides mathematical functions and constants, including math.pi, which represents the mathematical constant œÄ (Pi).
Taking Input from the User:

radians = int(input("Enter radians value: ")):
This line prompts the user to input a value in radians.
The input is taken as a string and is then converted to an integer using int(). This integer is stored in the variable radians.
Defining the Conversion Function:

def radians_to_degrees(radians)::

This line defines a function named radians_to_degrees that takes a single argument, radians.
The purpose of this function is to convert the radians value to degrees.
degrees = radians * (180 / math.pi):

Inside the function, the conversion from radians to degrees is performed using the formula:
degrees
=
radians
√ó
(
180
ùúã
)
degrees=radians√ó( 
œÄ
180
‚Äã
 )
The math.pi is used to access the value of œÄ.
return degrees:

This line returns the converted value (in degrees) to the caller.
Calling the Function and Printing the Result:

degrees = radians_to_degrees(radians):

The radians_to_degrees() function is called with the user-provided radians value.
The result is stored in the variable degrees.
print(f"{radians} radians is equal to {degrees} degrees"):

This line prints the output, showing the original radians value and its corresponding degree value.
The f before the string indicates an f-string, which allows you to embed expressions inside string literals using {}.
